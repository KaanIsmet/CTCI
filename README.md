# CTCI C++ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CTCI) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, implemented in C++.

## Project Structure

The solutions are organized by chapters, following the book's structure:

- Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
- Chapter 2: Linked Lists
- Chapter 3: Stacks and Queues
- Chapter 4: Trees and Graphs
- Chapter 5: Bit Manipulation
- Chapter 6: Math and Logic Puzzles
- Chapter 7: Object-Oriented Design
- Chapter 8: Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Chapter 9: System Design and Scalability
- Chapter 10: Sorting and Searching
- Chapter 11: Testing
- Chapter 12: C and C++
- Chapter 13: Java
- Chapter 14: Databases
- Chapter 15: Threads and Locks
- Chapter 16: Moderate
- Chapter 17: Hard

## Setup and Compilation

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Make (optional, for build automation)
- Git (for version control)

### Building the Solutions
Each solution can be compiled individually:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 chapterX/problemY.cpp -o solution
```

## Testing
Each solution includes its own test cases to verify correctness. To run tests:
```bash
./solution
```

## File Naming Convention
Files are named according to the following pattern:
```
chapterX/X.Y_description.cpp
```
Where:
- X is the chapter number
- Y is the problem number
- description is a brief description of the problem

Example: `chapter1/1.1_is_unique.cpp`
